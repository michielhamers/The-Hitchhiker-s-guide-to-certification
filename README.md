# The Hitchhiker's guide to certification

As mentioned in the session here a overview of my view on MS Certification and the links.

### Location
- First exam? 
Go to a exam centre and accept that you maybe need a second try.
- Second try?
Costs the same as a first try, however you've no experience in taking a exam. Check not only the first page of the results, but also page 2-3. There is somewhere (page2/3) a list of 3 attention points that you can search on internet (literally copy & paste) to learn more about those 3 topics. (I'm not refering to the first page with bars)
- Next exam? 
Choose (examlocation?): are you taking the ease of a exam location?
    Pro: Ease of location
    Pro: no issue when test computer has issues
    Con: You can only schedule when the test location is open and mostly only 2 shifts in a day.
Choose (home / online proctored exam): a
    Pro: Anywhere in the country you live on. 
    Pro: almost any time of the day you can schedule exam
    Con: You need to have a clutter free space
    Con: No extra devices are allowed to attach to your tast taking machine
    Con: No extra or smart devices are allowed in the room
    Con: You need REALLY a empty / clean desk
    Con: NO ONE is allowed (besides you) to be in that room
    Con: If someone is interupting for 1 second: you've failed the test
    Con: If your internet connection is lagging: you've failed the test
    Con: If you can not be identified with a foto / webcam: you've failed the test
    Con: (also at exam location) you are NOT allowed to wear smart watch
I prefer home exams...
